# node2loc
it first uses node2vec to learn node embedding of proteins from a interaction network, then the learned embedding is fed into a recurrenct neural network for classifying protein subcellular locations.

## Learn node embedding from a protein-protein network using node2vec

## Visualize the learned embedding in 2D space.

## train a LSTM classifier using learned embedding
